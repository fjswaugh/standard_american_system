Each section or subsection should describe a bid and a set of responses, with important response
bids getting their own subsection with their own responses.

Interference should be dealt with as a subsubsection, e.g.

> Fancy convention (sub)section
> -----------------------------
> 
> THE BID
>     RESPONSES
> 
> *Interference subsubsection*
> 
> RESPONSES AFTER INTERFERENCE
