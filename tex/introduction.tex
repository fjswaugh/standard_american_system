This system is based on Standard American. It uses 5-card majors, a strong no trump, three weak
twos, and a smattering of other conventions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{HCPs} refers to the Milton point count
    \item \textbf{Points} strictly refers to the total point count, which includes points for length
        above 4 cards in a suit, and points for shortness if you have found a fit and wish to play
        in a trump contract. Points may also be adjusted based on other factors that make a hand
        seem more/less favourable (e.g. singleton king is less good than supported king in a 5-card
        suit).
    \item \textbf{Losing tricks} refers to the losing trick count (possibly adjusted to make e.g.
        unsupported Qxx worth 2Â½ losers instead of 2).
    \item \textbf{4(3)+ card support} means that you would normally have 4 card support to make this
        bid, but will occasionally have only 3 (although would hopefully have extra values to
        compensate)
\end{itemize}
