Each section should describe a bid and a set of responses, with important response bids getting
their own subsection with their own responses.

If a subsection describes a bid with lots of continuations, then there should be either:
    (a) Subsubsections that list the most important continuations (e.g. Stayman continuations)
    (b) Another section that describes a major continuation bid (e.g. Ogust after Multi-Landy)

(b) is particularly useful if the bid can occur after multiple different paths.

Subsubsections are the lowest level of structure, and so will often contain multiple continuations
after multiple bids in a certain category.  Subsubsections may be devoted to single bids and
continuations (in the same way as subsections), but the structure may be somewhat looser. 

Interference should be dealt with as a subsubsection, e.g.

> Fancy convention (sub)section
> -----------------------------
> 
> THE BID
>     RESPONSES
> 
> *Interference subsubsection*
> 
> RESPONSES AFTER INTERFERENCE
